Fastmail - Folder Badge Controls
-----------------------

Want to see a badge with the total number of messages on certain folders? Never want to see a badge on some folders?  Then this is the program for you.

Fastmail Folder Badge Controls allows you to specify a list of folders to:

* Show total number of messages (read and unread) on badge.
* Always show a badge, even if it says 0.
* Never show a badge.

It was inspired by [MailMate](http://freron.com/), a powerful desktop email client with customizable folder badges.  I wanted to bring some of that customizability to Fastmail's web interface.

### Installation

This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) / [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) user script.  It has been tested in both Firefox and Chrome.
