Fastmail Badge Controls
-----------------------

Want to see a badge with the total number of messages on certain folders? Never want to see a badge on some folders, even if they contain unread messages?  Then this is the program for you.

Fastmail Badge Controls was inspired by [MailMate](http://freron.com/), a powerful desktop email client with customizable folder badges.  I wanted to bring some of that customizability to Fastmail's web interface.

### Installation

This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) / [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) user script.  It has been tested in both Firefox and Chrome.

To install Fastmail Badge Controls:

1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) if you're using Firefox, or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) if you're using Chrome.
2. Click here to install Fastmail Badge Controls.
3. Visit [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), where a configuration box will open automatically.  The configuration box is only auto-displayed after you've first installed Fastmail Badge Controls.

### Configuration

Fastmail Badge Controls allows you to specify a list of folders to:

* Show total number of messages (read and unread) on badge.
* Always show a badge, even if it says 0.
* Never show a badge.

To return to the configuration settings, while visiting [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/):

* In Firefox, navigate to Tools > Greasemonkey > User script commands... > Folder badge configuration
* In Chrome, click the Tampermonkey menu button, then click 'Folder badge configuration'
